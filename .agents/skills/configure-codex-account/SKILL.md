name: configure-codex-account
description: Point the Codex CLI adapter at a different account or provider. Use when a run must use a ChatGPT subscription, an API-key route, or a Chinese provider such as Z.AI, DeepSeek, or Xiaomi, or when the model lives behind a provider endpoint instead of the account login.
compatibility: Linux, Node.js 24+, an installed Codex CLI, and this repository's installed dependencies.

# Run Codex on a chosen account

The adapter measures whatever `codex` is authenticated as, unless a provider route replaces that
login. Read `docs/running.md` and keep the suite already selected by
`publish-benchmark-observation`. Account routing does not set the suite's run policy.
Commands that call a model need approval; `benchmark:submit` also publishes a candidate.

## A ChatGPT subscription

```sh
npm run benchmark:submit -- --suite SUITE --harness codex-cli-default --model gpt-5.6-luna --thinking low \
  --auth-file "$HOME/.codex/auth.json"
```

`--auth-file` copies that one file into the sandbox, where the adapter reads it through
`CODEX_HOME=/state/codex`. Sign in with `codex login` first; the subscription is what pays, and the
published transport stays `harness-native`. Replace `SUITE` with the selected registered suite.

## Your own provider key, including Chinese providers

Ready-made provider blocks are checked in at `configs/chinese-flash-roster.json`. Copy the one you
need into a private file and keep the key in a separate env file:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-benchmark.mjs --harness codex-cli-default --model glm-5.3-flash --thinking low \
  --provider-file provider.json --env-file private-env.json --output /tmp/codex-route.json
npm run benchmark -- raw-run --config /tmp/codex-route.json --smoke \
  --task replace-all-10-plain --run-id NEW_SMOKE_ID
```

Fields the Codex adapter uses from the provider block:

- `id`, `displayName`, `apiKeyEnv` — the route name, the label, and the environment variable name;
- `endpoints.responses` — Codex speaks the Responses API, so this one is required;
- `codexReasoningEffort` — whether to send `model_reasoning_effort` with your thinking level;
- `transport` — the published label, `direct-responses` by default.

Use the user's approved provider credential and the env name required by that
provider block. Do not assume a key is already installed in Pi or borrow another
account. The prepared smoke is a one-task auth check using the original exact-edit
task, not a scored run of the selected suite. Read its actual exit and report, then
return to the publishing skill with the same suite and account.

## Keep the secrets local

The adapter writes the route into a private `codex/config.toml` inside the sandbox and passes the
key through the environment. `provider.json`, `private-env.json`, and `benchmark.config.ts` are
ignored by git for that reason, and the prepared config carries the values from the env file, so
never submit it. The published bundle holds the route label, never a key.
